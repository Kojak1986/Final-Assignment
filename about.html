 <p>Nintendo, having been founded in 1889, is the oldest video-game company in the world. Originally the company produced card-games but from the 1960s onward it ventured into numerous different business ventures before finally landing in the lucrative video-game industry, which is where it would eventually leave its mark.</p><br>

<p>Nintendo’s first foray into gaming was as the Japanese importer of the Magnavox Odyssey, the very first commercially sold video-game console. However, the Odyssey never reached the popularity and fame of Atari‘s Pong game which would be copied by numerous companies in the 1970s. Even, eventually, by Nintendo who released the TV Colour Game in 1977, making it technically the company’s first console.</p><br>

<p>However, it was in the arcades where Nintendo would eventually make its biggest impression. The 1979 arcade title “RadarScope” was a huge success in Japan but failed upon its release in the US. The game would be dramatically redesigned and re-released as the oddly titled arcade hit game “Donkey Kong” in 1980. Designed by a then unknown Shigeru Miyamoto, the game introduced Mario to the world who would go on to become the company’s mascot. With more arcade hits including the sequels to Donkey Kong and the 1984 hit “Mario Bros.” Nintendo became Japan’s leading arcade game developer.</p><br>

<p>Additionally Nintendo had success in the early hand-held gaming market with its Game & Watch line of LCD-portable games, which included portable versions of its hit arcade titles.</p><br>

<h2 class="featureHeader">Nintendo Entertainment System</h2>

<p>In 1983 Nintendo finally decided to take the leap into the world of console-manufacturing and created the Nintendo Family Computer, commonly referred to as the FamiCom. The system became hugely succesful (even in spite of faulty processors in some of the early consoles) quickly outselling its only domestic competitor, Sega‘s SG-1000 line of consoles. Nintendo also wanted to bring the FamiCom over to the US but unfortunately in the aftermath of the Video-Game Industry crash of 1983, American retailers were not interested in Video-Game systems of any kind.</p><br>

<p>Nintendo would dramatically redesign the FamiCom and employ clever wording and accessory usage to have its console penetrate the US markets as both a home computer and a toy principally. The redesigned console was called the Nintendo Entertainment System, known by its common acronym as the NES. The system’s release in 1985 was a huge hit, promoted by the hit game “Super Mario Bros”. The system reinvigorated the video-game markets in the United States and also started the third and last generation of 8-bit consoles which Nintendo dominated.</p><br>

<p>The most notable gaming features of the NES was its horizontal game-pad which replaced Joysticks and other alternate types of controllers as the de facto design for video game consoles. Instead of a joystick the gamepad featured four Directional Buttons (commonly known as the D-Pad) which also became a standard feature of most consoles (although the Atari 7600 released two years later originally came with a tiny control-stick – it could be switched with a D-pad inclusive controller).</p><br>

<p>Nintendo also enforced strict restrictions for game releases on its system. Most notable Nintendo introduced the practice of having developers licence their games for the system before they could be legally sold. This practice did not exists during the early 1980s and was one of the main causes of the over-saturation of the video-game market as well as the resulting market crash.</p><br>

<p>Nintendo would also deal harshly with companies that tried to go around the licensing practice (most notably Tengen) but Nintendo also enforced a three-year release restrictions on any games that were released first on the NES. This meant that games released first on the NES could not be released on other systems for up to three years. In addition Nintendo restricted developers from releasing more than five games per year. Nintendo has been often criticized for these latter practices which it did not continue past the NES’s eventual discontinuation in the early 1990s.</p><br>
